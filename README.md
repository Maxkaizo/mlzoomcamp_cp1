# Brain Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

# Introduction

In this project, I'll implement a brain cancer detection system using CT and MRI images, leveraging the potential of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and tools. I'll document all data processing in the [notebook.ipynb]() file and all additional or context information will be here in the README.MD

# Problem Description
Brain cancer is one of the most critical and life-threatening medical conditions, requiring precise and timely diagnosis to improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on manual interpretation of CT and MRI scans by radiologists, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to errors due to the complexity and variability of tumor presentations.

This project aims to address the challenge of automating brain tumor detection and classification by developing a deep learning-based solution. The objective is to create a system capable of accurately identifying brain tumors from multimodal imaging data (CT and MRI scans) and classifying them into specific tumor types. By integrating cutting-edge Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, the project seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, ultimately aiding healthcare professionals in decision-making processes.

# Domain Context
If you need (as I did) some context regarding the referred medical procedures, what is a CT Scan and an MRI, I'm including some definitions [here]()

# Dataset 
I'll use the [Brain tumor multimodal image (CT & MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murtozalikhon/brain-tumor-multimodal-image-ct-and-mri/code) dataset from kaggle wich includes a collection of scans included in several sources, as stated in its description "the dataset includes high-resolution CT and MRI images captured from multiple patients, with each image labeled with the corresponding tumor type (e.g., glioma, meningioma, etc.) and its location within the brain. This combination of CT and MRI images aims to leverage the strengths of both imaging techniques: CT scans for clear bone structure visualization and MRI for soft tissue details, enabling a more accurate analysis of brain tumors".
