# Brain Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

# Introduction

In this project, I'll implement a brain cancer detection system using CT and MRI images, leveraging the potential of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and tools.

# Problem Description


# Dataset 
I'll use the [Brain tumor multimodal image (CT & MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murtozalikhon/brain-tumor-multimodal-image-ct-and-mri/code) dataset from kaggle wich includes a collection of scans included in several sources, as stated in its description "the dataset includes high-resolution CT and MRI images captured from multiple patients, with each image labeled with the corresponding tumor type (e.g., glioma, meningioma, etc.) and its location within the brain. This combination of CT and MRI images aims to leverage the strengths of both imaging techniques: CT scans for clear bone structure visualization and MRI for soft tissue details, enabling a more accurate analysis of brain tumors".
