## CT Scan

A CT Scan, or Computed Tomography Scan, is a medical imaging technique that uses X-rays combined with computer processing to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body. It provides a quick and effective way to visualize internal structures such as bones, organs, and tissues. CT Scans are commonly used for detecting abnormalities like tumors or masses but lack the level of tissue differentiation needed to classify specific types of conditions, making them ideal for initial diagnoses or general assessments.

- Uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the body.
- Primarily detects general abnormalities, such as masses or tumors, without providing detailed tissue differentiation.

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce highly detailed images of the body's internal structures, particularly soft tissues. Unlike CT Scans, MRI does not use ionizing radiation, making it safer for repeated use. It is especially effective for visualizing the brain, spinal cord, and other complex tissues, enabling the precise identification and classification of conditions such as tumors, making it a critical tool in diagnosing and monitoring neurological and musculoskeletal disorders.

- Uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images, especially of soft tissues.
- Provides higher precision for identifying specific types of tumors compared to CT Scans.

### **Tumor Types Identified in MRI:**
- **Glioma:**
  - Tumors originating from glial cells in the brain or spinal cord.
  - Can range from low-grade to highly malignant (e.g., glioblastoma).

- **Meningioma:**
  - Tumors that develop in the meninges, the protective layers covering the brain and spinal cord.
  - Typically benign but can exert pressure on surrounding structures.

- **Pituitary Tumor:**
  - Tumors located in the pituitary gland at the brain's base.
  - Often benign but may disrupt hormonal functions.

- **Tumor (Generic):**
  - A broader category for cases where the tumor type is unspecified or does not fall into the above classifications. 

This structure provides the foundation for understanding the dataset and preparing it for further preprocessing and modeling.
